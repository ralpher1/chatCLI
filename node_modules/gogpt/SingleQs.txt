user: I just want to see some react code, show me some

assistant: Sure! Here's a simple example of a React component written in JavaScript:

```jsx
// This is a React component called "HelloWorld"
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// This is how you can render the component to the web page
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this code, we have a component called "HelloWorld". It is a class that extends the `React.Component` class, which allows it to be a React component. The `render()` method of the component returns the HTML that should be displayed on the web page.

In this case, the `render()` method returns a `div` element containing an `h1` element with the text "Hello, World!". Finally, we use the `ReactDOM.render()` function to render the `HelloWorld` component to the web page.
